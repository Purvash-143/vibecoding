# Summary: Complete CI/CD Pipeline for Insurance Application

## 🎉 **CI/CD Pipeline Created Successfully!**

I've created a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with all 6 requested stages that will warn (not fail) for test failures and deploy to your EKS cluster.

### 📁 **Files Created:**

```

└── vibecoding/
    └── .prettierrc                 # Code formatting rules
```

### 🚀 **Pipeline Stages:**

1. **🔍 GitLeaks** - Secret detection (warns only)
2. **🧹 Linting** - ESLint + Prettier syntax check (warns only)
3. **🔒 CodeQL** - Security analysis (warns only)
4. **🏗️ Build** - Application build + Docker image push to ECR
5. **🛡️ Trivy** - Docker vulnerability scan (warns only)
6. **🚀 Deploy** - Deploy to EKS cluster (only if build succeeds)

### 🔐 **Required GitHub Actions Secrets:**

Add these in **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets**:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: [Your AWS Access Key]
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: [Your AWS Secret Key]  
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID: 777203855866
```

### 📊 **Required GitHub Actions Variables:**

Add these in **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables**:

```
AWS_REGION: ap-south-1
ECR_REPOSITORY: insurance-app
EKS_CLUSTER_NAME: eks-nvai-devops
KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE: insurance-application
```

### ⚡ **Key Features:**

- **✅ All test stages continue on error** (warn but don't fail pipeline)
- **✅ Automatic Docker build and push to ECR**
- **✅ Automatic deployment to EKS cluster**
- **✅ Health checks after deployment**
- **✅ Security scanning with results in GitHub Security tab**
- **✅ Comprehensive logging and artifacts**
- **✅ Deployment summary with public URL**

### 🎯 **Triggers:**

- **Push**: `main` and `develop` branches
- **Pull Request**: targeting `main` branch

### 🛡️ **Security Features:**

- GitLeaks for secret detection
- CodeQL for security vulnerabilities  
- Trivy for container vulnerabilities
- All scan results uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- AWS credentials securely managed

### 📈 **Monitoring:**

- Pipeline status in GitHub Actions tab
- Security scan results in Security tab
- Deployment artifacts and logs
- External URL provided after successful deployment

### 🚀 **How to Use:**

1. **Set up secrets and variables** in GitHub repository settings
2. **Push code to `main` or `develop`** branch
3. **Monitor pipeline** in GitHub Actions tab
4. **Access deployed app** via provided LoadBalancer URL

### 🔧 **AWS IAM Permissions Required:**

Your AWS user needs:
- ECR: Push/pull Docker images
- EKS: Describe clusters and update kubeconfig
- STS: Get caller identity

### 📱 **Pipeline Output:**

After successful deployment, you'll get:
- **Public URL**: `http://k8s-insuranc-insuranc-xxx.elb.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com`
- **Health Check**: Automatic validation
- **Deployment Summary**: Pods, services, and status

The pipeline is designed to be **production-ready** with proper error handling, security scanning, and deployment validation while ensuring that test failures only warn and don't block deployments! 🎉
